# Exact solutions to relativistic stars in gravity and beyond

## Exact static spherical symmetric solutions in general relativity
The Mathematica notebook _standardTOV.nb_ rederives the solutions in [Tolman's 1939 seminal paper](https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.55.364) using the $(- + + +)$ metric signature.

## Exact solutions to relativistic stars in $f(R)$ gravity
Mathematica notebooks that computes exact solutions to relativistic stars in $f(R)$ models of gravity using the reconstruction method described in the article [Some exact relativistic star solutions in $f(R)$ gravity](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6382/adc8f2).
